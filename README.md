# Blockchain-Based Electronic Voting System

A decentralized, secure, and transparent electronic voting system built on Ethereum blockchain using Solidity smart contracts.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

This voting system consists of **4 interconnected smart contracts** that work together to provide a complete electoral solution:

### Core Contracts

1. **`ElectionOfficer.sol`** - Manages election officials and commissioner
2. **`Voter.sol`** - Handles voter registration and management  
3. **`Candidate.sol`** - Manages candidate registration and verification
4. **`GeneralElections.sol`** - Orchestrates the actual voting process

### System Roles

- **Election Commissioner** - Root authority with supreme control
- **Election Officers** - Appointed officials who verify participants
- **Voters** - Verified individuals who can cast votes
- **Candidates** - Verified individuals who can contest elections

## üöÄ Features

### Security & Transparency
- **Immutable voting records** stored on blockchain
- **Public verification** of all transactions
- **Role-based access control** with strict permissions
- **Time-based restrictions** for registration and voting periods

### User Management
- **Voter verification** using Aadhar numbers (12-byte unique identifiers)
- **Candidate verification** with security deposits
- **Emergency removal** capabilities for invalid participants
- **Comprehensive data tracking** and statistics

### Voting Process
- **One vote per voter** per election
- **Constituency-based** candidate selection
- **Automatic result calculation**
- **Real-time vote counting**
